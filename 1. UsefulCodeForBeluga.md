## Useful codes to use for Beluga Cluster ##

### Knowledge of basic Unix/Linux commands are necessary ###

If you want to apply for an account, here's a link explaining how:

Once you get confirmation for your registration (24-48h), here are useful codes to know.

**1. Connect to the cluster**: Use ssh on your terminal (type **command** + **space**,then search for **Terminal**)
<br /> ```ssh username@beluga.computecanada.ca```



*Essentially, compute canada works the same as your own terminal. However, for any commands that would last more than*
<br /> *more than 3 mintutes, you should run a ```sbatch``` job (for more info, see below)*



**2. Which directory should you choose?**
<br /> You should **RUN** your analysis on the scratch directory. This is a temporary directory where every data is erased **every two months** (you will be notified by a week in advance email). 


<br /> **Why using this directory?** This directory have **more storage (20T)** and **is faster** to process-in. When you finish your analysis, you will transfer your files to **your own private directory**.
<br /> ```cd /home/tangsab8/scratch/``` 


<br /> You should **STORE** your outputs on your **private** directory. This directory has access to the privileges your PI 
<br /> might have bought and is under the **project** folder.
<br /> ```cd /home/username/projects/ctb-PI/username/YourProjectDirectory(optional)/```

**#3. How to transfer files on the cluster?**
For general information, see: https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Transferring_data


<br /> **For small files:**
<br /> You can use ```scp``` command to copy from your own terminal (*you will have to ```exit``` to leave the cluster to do it your own terminal*)
<br /> Transfer a file to folder on Beluga (Computer -> Beluga): 
<br />  ```scp /Path/to/Computer/File username@beluga.computecanada.ca:/Path/to/Beluga/Folder/```
<br /> Transfer a folder from Beluga to your computer (Beluga -> Computer): 
<br />  ```scp -r tangsab8@beluga.computecanada.ca:/Path/to/Beluga/Folder/ /Path/to/Computer/Folder ```
<br /> *Note the ``` -r ``` allows you to specify if your transfering a **folder** or a **file** .*
<br /> For more information ```scp```, see : http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php


<br /> **For bigger files (300 GB & +) :**
<br /> You should use **Globus** guided-user interface to transfer files. You will log in with your id: username; pwassword: same as on computecanada. 
See: https://auth.globus.org/p/login?redirect_uri=%2Fv2%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3Dd3b6054b-92e4-11e5-8a1d-3c970e0c9cc4%26scope%3Durn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Aauth.globus.org%253Aview_identities%2520urn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Anexus.api.globus.org%253Agroups%2520urn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Atransfer.api.globus.org%253Aall%26response_type%3Dtoken%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fglobus.computecanada.ca%252Flogin%26redirect_name%3DCompute%2520Canada%2520Globus%2520Web%2520App%26state%3Dn036kay823c&response_type=token&client_id=d3b6054b-92e4-11e5-8a1d-3c970e0c9cc4&scope=urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Aauth.globus.org%3Aview_identities+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Anexus.api.globus.org%3Agroups+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Atransfer.api.globus.org%3Aall&redirect_name=Compute+Canada+Globus+Web+App


For more complete information on how to use Globus, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIfeVxplZ8U. You will need to download Globus Personal Endpoint, which will open in your browser your own Globus interface.


**#4. To use the different softwares (in this case, *modules*) available in compute canada**, you will need to **load** them (as you would on R, python or most softwares).
Here's a list of all the available softwares : https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Available_software. You first need to specify the software version you will be using. For example, if you want to use fsl, I will type ``` module spider fsl``` , which will give you as output all the availables versions.
Then, you will load the package typing ```module load fsl/6.0.1``` 


**#5. If you want to download packages or any other resources, what do you need to do? You will need to create a virtual environment**
This will allow to prevent interaction from your own packages to the one of the softwares. This will be useful to run a Notebook of your scripts (i.e. Jupyter Notebook), or to install python packages.
For general information on the command ```virtualenv```, see: https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Python


***Set up an environment called ```ENV``` on your directory of interest***
<br /> ``` $ module load python/3.7.0 ``` *Need to use python to create environment*
<br /> ``` $ virtualenv --no-download /Path/to/your/directory/ENV ``` *Create the virtual environment*
<br /> ``` $ source /Path/to/your/directory/ENV/bin/activate ``` *Activate the virtual environment*
<br /> ``` $ pip install --no-index --upgrade pip ``` *Upgrade the installation pip function to the newest version*
<br /> ``` $ pip install "PYTHON PACKAGE" ``` *Download any package of your choice*
<br /> ``` $ deactivate ``` *To deactivate your environment*


**This will help you use Jupyter Notebook, R or any other software on compute canada**
