# CLBP_FunctionalConnectivity

Here is my project for the Brain Hack School 2019. This project will study functional connectivity with fMRI on patients experiencing chronic low back pain. The data were acquired from OpenPain by the Apkarian Lab, in Northwestern University (http://www.openpain.org/dataPortal.html)
*NOTE: I downloaded the data in mid-June. However, the structural scans are currently removed because of faulty face deprecation in session 3, 4 and 5. My project will be based on the baseline scans, on session 2. For this reason, you may not find the full datas online (they will be released back in September), only the functional datas.
This datasets was obtained from a placebo study where I selected the CLBP participants, at baseline (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05859-1)*
