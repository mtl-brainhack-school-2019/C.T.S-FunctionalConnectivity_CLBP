#### Functional Connectivity on Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients ####
## By Christophe Tanguay-Sabourin (GitHub: CTanguay-Sabourin)##

Here is my project for the Brain Hack School 2019. 

## Which dataset do you want to analyze (if any)? ##
* For my project, I will use a dataset available on **OpenPain**, an open access data sharing platform for brain imaging studies of human pain. This online resources is provided by the Apkarian Lab, in Northwestern University. The dataset is named

The dataset that I will be using originates from a RCT study placebo for patients experiencing chronic low back pain (available on

This project will observe functional connectivity with rsfMRI on patients experiencing chronic low back pain. 
The data were acquired from OpenPain by the Apkarian Lab, in Northwestern University (http://www.openpain.org/dataPortal.html)

*NOTE: The structural data are currently not available on OpenPain (only functional data), but they should be in September. A subset of the data was selected (i.e. the control group. For more information, see the original paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05859-1) with 68 patients, with their T1w and rsBOLD.*

## Which tools do you want to learn? ##



## Which kind of deliverable do you want to implement: analysis, code, data, tutorial...? ##


## What kind of medium will you use to present the results? ##



### What I'm aiming to do in this project: ###
* Install and operate fmriprep pre-processing on Compute Canada clusters
* Write all my scripts (from the installation of fmriprep on Beluga to my statistical analysis) in python & bash 
    * They will all be posted on GitHub repo
* Make a Jupyter Notebook of my analysis
* Export different brain parcellations (types & sizes) to implement in the functional connectivity
      * Network Modules (17 parcellations, by Yeo 2011 and ???)
      * Fine-grain parcellations (400 parcellations, by Schaefer & Yeo 2018 and 264 parcellations, by Power & Peterson 2011)
* Write and run a script for functional connectivity analysis
* Cross-validate my results
